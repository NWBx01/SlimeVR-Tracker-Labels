# SlimeVR Tracker Labels

These sticker labels are designed with the Hyperion case, designed by Smeltie, in mind, but they can pretty easily be used with whatever case you want! Included are both individual labels, as well as a few premade sheets that can easily be printed out.

There are several variations of labels available:
- Multicolored Labels / Black Labels / White Labels
- Small Borders / Large Borders
- New SlimeVR Logo / Old SlimeVR Logo

Example of the main differences between borders and SlimeVR logo:

## Printing and Usage

When it comes to applying these labels to your case there's a few ways you can go about this:
- Clear Printable Sticker Sheets
- White Printable Sticker Sheets
- Regular Printer Paper Cut to Size and Taped on

Bear in mind, if you get some clear printable sticker sheets your stickers might be hard to see on a dark case. Likewise, if your printer does not have white ink, you won't be able to print white labels.
